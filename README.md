This native Android app, developed in Kotlin, follows the MVVM architecture with Jetpack Compose and Hilt. It includes a splash screen, a user list screen, and a user details screen. The app fetches data from a remote JSON endpoint using Retrofit and handles asynchronous operations with Coroutines and StateFlow. It groups items by list ID, sorts them, and filters out invalid entries. Navigation between screens is implemented using Jetpack Compose navigation. The entire UI is built with Compose, ensuring a clean interface and efficient data handling for a seamless user experience.
